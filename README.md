```bat
npm start
```

and navigate to [`localhost:8080`](http://localhost:8080/)

## Usage
### Loading RDF
#### From a remote URI
Put a URL-encoded URI in the fragment to load remote RDF.

**Remote URI MUST support both `text/turtle` and `CORS`.**

[Try it online](https://langsamu.github.io/rdf-3d/#https%3A%2F%2Fquery.wikidata.org%2Fsparql%3Fquery%3DCONSTRUCT%2520WHERE%257B%253Fs%2520%253Fp%2520%253Fo%257D%2520OFFSET%25203000%2520LIMIT%2520100) or locally:
[`http://localhost:8080/#https%3A%2F%2Fquery.wikidata.org...`](http://localhost:8080/#https%3A%2F%2Fquery.wikidata.org%2Fsparql%3Fquery%3DCONSTRUCT%2520WHERE%257B%253Fs%2520%253Fp%2520%253Fo%257D%2520OFFSET%25203000%2520LIMIT%2520100)
(This visualizes an arbitrary query from the Wikidata SPARQL endpoint.)

#### From a local file
Put an RDF file serialized as TURTLE in the `docs` folder and reference it by file name in the fragment:
[`http://localhost:8080/#FibonacciSequenceUntyped.ttl`](http://localhost:8080/#FibonacciSequenceUntyped.ttl)
